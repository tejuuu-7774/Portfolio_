      <p className="text-gray-600">
        I’m Tejaswini, a frontend-focused developer who enjoys turning ideas
        into clean, structured web experiences. I like working close to the UI
        while still respecting performance and maintainability.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        I’ve worked with React and Next.js to build real projects, explored
        backend APIs, and I care deeply about writing code that’s readable,
        calm, and intentional.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        Currently, I’m strengthening my fundamentals and building projects
        that reflect consistency rather than shortcuts.
